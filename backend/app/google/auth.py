    Retrieves valid Google OAuth2 credentials.
    
    This function handles the lifecycle of the credentials:
    1. Loads existing token from disk (google_token.json) if it exists.
    2. Validates the token. If it is expired but has a refresh token, it automatically refreshes it.
    3. If the token is invalid, missing, or cannot be refreshed, it raises an exception so that
       the standalone authorize.py script can be run to re-run the full browser authentication flow.
       
    OAUTH2 CONCEPTS EXPLAINED:
    - Access Token: A short-lived token (usually expires in 1 hour) passed with API requests to authenticate.
    - Refresh Token: A long-lived token stored on the server/device. Used to request a new access token
      without requiring user interaction.
    - Consent Screen: The screen displayed to the user showing the app name, requested scopes, and permissions.
    - Testing Mode: In Google Cloud Console, if the OAuth consent screen is in "Testing" status, user tokens
      expire after 7 days, requiring the user to re-authenticate (re-run authorize.py) weekly.
